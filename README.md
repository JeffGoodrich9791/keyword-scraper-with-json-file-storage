<h2>Project-Scope</h2>
<p>This was my first web scraper built using the Python language in Visual Studio Code. This tool was originally developed as a class used in the first step of building food and drink recipe url databases. The next step is to build a class of extractors to navigate to the urls and extract recipe information through dynamic and static content, then dump the files to build specific objects for each culture/region/type of food. The databases will eventually be used to create a "Recipe Fusionator", but it can be used to search and store other urls just by changing the "keyword"</p>
